QUOTEME
=======

*PHP script to store and view random quotes.*

Q.uote.me is a simple PHP script to manage your quotes.

Actually, you have your favorite quotes in multiple txt files, one for your mails, another for your web app, etc...

When you find a new quote, you have to update your files... It can be boring !

With this script, you manage only one SQL database. With his API, you read it in your favorite format (actualy, json, rss2, csv).
